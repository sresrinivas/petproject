##  Why This Definition?

Most definitions of DevOps focus on culture, collaboration, and tools. While those matter, they overlook the reality DevOps engineers face in production:

- A container failing due to file system issues
- A Windows VM not joining a domain
- A .NET app crashing due to service conflicts
- A pipeline passing, but deployment failing on the target OS

This is where **System Engineering** and **Application Engineering** merge â€” and that's where **true DevOps lives**.

## ðŸ”§ System Engineering Includes:
- OS-level management (Windows/Linux)
- Networking, firewall, DNS, backup, failover
- Cloud IaaS (Azure VM, AWS EC2)
- Scripting (PowerShell, Bash)
- Hybrid identity (Azure AD, IAM)

##  Application Engineering Includes:
- Source control & CI/CD
- Framework-specific build & runtime knowledge (.NET, Java, Python)
- Dependency management
- Debugging, monitoring, logging
- App configuration across environments

---

##  Who Should Use This Definition?

- DevOps Engineers
- Platform Engineers
- Cloud Architects
- SREs
- Trainers and Students

This definition supports a **complete understanding of DevOps** in hybrid and enterprise environments.
